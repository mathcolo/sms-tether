SMS Tether allows users to respond to text messages on their phone from their computer, not to be confused with traditional internet tethering. This software is currently only developed for Android 2.1+ and Mac OS X 10.6+, but a cross-platform version for Windows and Linux may be coming soon.

Both the Mac application and the Android application do work, but they have not been officially released. They must be compiled first before usage.

Please note: Standard SMS charges for phones still apply. Please be responsible!
